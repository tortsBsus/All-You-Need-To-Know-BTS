                  <h3>Why he is important for the team?</h3>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                      What can J-Hope not do? He is a complete package.<br> Let it be singing, rapping, dancing, producing, writing, <br>producing and what not as a musician and performer. He can do it all.<br><br> While being in the rapline with Suga and RM, he also helps produce songs with them.<br> The visual and rapper he is always gets jaws dropping after showing his talent.
                      <br><br>
                      While J-Hope might not be the leader of BTS, he’s considered <br>the choreography leader and is always pushing his members to <br>perfect the choreographies to the best of their abilities. <br><br>He is such an amazing Dancer that you will be in awe if you see his stage <br>persona as a dancer. Initially selected for the vocal line,<br> he was then trained hard to become the present rapper he is. 
                      <br><br> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5U1XqpEGLeDd48dDFNqQEC?si=5nIWWM9bSOeO1MRI9gCb3w"><b><i>MAMA</i></b></a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0usLRFLmYXYahKNgXxsuJc?si=JjdDWQElTrSweOi0q5ggig"><b><i>Trivia 起 : Just Dance</i></b></a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3r9FFjLrAIQjoR8pSHVPC9?si=YJpf4qU5Q7OlNU-7CfWRPw"><b><i>Outro : Ego</i></b></a> which are his solos from the <br>albums of the group show how much of a main rapper <br>and the performer of the team he is.
                      <br><br>As far as I know, J-Hope is literally loved by anyone who wants a<br> whole load of package with a bundle of happiness with it. 
                  </p>
