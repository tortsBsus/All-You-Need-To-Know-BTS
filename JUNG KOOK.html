                  <h3>Why he is so important for the team?</h3>
                  <br>
                  <p><br>Being the Vocalist he is, he's truly such a powerful center <br>when leading their choreographies. The second he comes on screen <br>his presence commands attention due to the amazing "performer" he is.<br><br>Jungkook has been known to affect consumers’ behavior, with fans oftenflocking 
                     <br>to buy products he promotes. <br>This phenomenon even has a name: The Jungkook Effect.
                     <br><br> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6KQSeSPqBa15gMWLO1fdkk?si=0atWF9RBSemQeEeEPte2YA"><b><i>Begin</i></b></a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3p6hnejEQYXkiTO1lAzVc0?si=FL1xin21S-mMm_IiSKdyRA"><b><i>Euphoria</i></b></a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4vTgx6h4seHvkuFh84JXYP?si=dRYeOfLHT56T0doNYp_ECw"><b><i>My Time</i></b></a> which are his solos from the <br>albums of the group show the importance of his voice in the team.
                     <br><br>Everyone falls for his innocent and sweet bunny-like smile with those<br> big doe eyes that show how much of a soft boy he is.<br> But what you wont notice is how his body line and tattoos lie within those black <br>baggy-clothes that makes him the baddest Gen-Z E-boy that he actually is.<br>
                     Jungkook's first love is ARMY and so is he their first one.

                  <h3>Other things you would want to know about the Maknae</h3>
                  <br>
                  <p> Even after getting many invites from other companies, Jungkook Joined BigHit Entertainment, knowing and trusting the one rapper he loved and found inspiration. The rapper being "RM" himself.
                      <br><br>
                      "We all have lots to pitch in, there’s no knowing what will come but hard work will get us somewhere." - Jungkook, 2017.04.03, USA.
                     <br><br>Jungkook, even according to himself, is a manifestation of the personalities of his six older brothers in Bangtan - that is, he is a mix of the best character traits of Bangtan.<br><br> Brought up and raised by them since he was 15, the rest of them brought a young middle schooler so introverted he would cry when asked to sing and shower only after everyone was asleep <br>to the gorgeous, bunny-smiled main vocalist we know today as the Golden Maknae.
                     <br><br>
                     He shoots his own vlogs or a small film to the places he travels with his bandmates and films it with his point of view or perspective. 
                     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgTwJQ2CUqI&list=PL5hrGMysD_GvSDAB-u5HNy4NtUxYkHwrg"><b><i>G.C.F's</i></b></a> are a treat for Army's since it is the world from Jungkook's eyes.
