                  <p>
                     <br>
                      On June 4, 2019, Jin released his first independent song "Tonight" as part of the 2019 BTS Festa event, <br>a yearly event celebrating the anniversary of the band's debut.<br> The acoustic ballad was composed by Jin alongside <br>Big Hit Entertainment record producers Slow Rabbit and Hiss Noise. 
                     <br><br>
                     The lyrics, written by Jin and BTS leader RM, are inspired by Jin's relationship with his pets. <br>The track was met with a generally positive reception, with praise <br>directed towards Jin's vocals and the song's calming atmosphere.
                      <br><br>
                     But this time, it was Jin himself who came bearing gifts. Just hours before his<br> 28th birthday, the singer surprised fans with a new solo song, titled “Abyss.”<br>Announced via Twitter with a note from Jin, the track was released <br>on BTS’s SoundCloud as well as the BANGTANTV YouTube channel. 
                      <br><br>
                     “Abyss” is also characterized by its soft yet piercing nature. The song’s lighthearted <br>ballad ambiance stands in stark contrast to its somber lyrics, <br>which ponder inner demons and inconsolable anxiety. In a heartfelt note, Jin said that the song was<br> "a vehicle to write about the things I wanted to say."
