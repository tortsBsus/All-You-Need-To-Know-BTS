      <H1>What is BTS?</H1>
      BTS is a 7 member boyband from a small company in South Korea. First debuting on 13 June 2013,
      their name is an acronym which stands for 'Beyond The Scene'. Though popular worldwide,
      their music is mainly in their native language, Korean, releasing their first fully English song only in 2020.
      Their success is opening doors for artists and media which is not primarily in English and is proving that music
      doesn't
      have a language.
