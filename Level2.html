                    variety show where the agenda of each episode involves a game which all seven play, often against
                    eachother, to win prizes and avoid punishments. What’s fascinating about Run
                    BTS is not just its wholesome irreverence, but also the way it complements who BTS are as a group.
                    It allows RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook to showcase totally different sides than
                    what you see in their highly polished, carefully choreographed music videos and performances. They
                    take whatever is thrown at them (and the producers throw a lot at them, like zombies) and
                    good-naturedly make themselves look ridiculous for the entertainment of the viewers — and, perhaps
                    best of all, themselves.</I><img src="CSS/Pictures/runbts.gif" class="gifss"></div>
